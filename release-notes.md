# Shuddhalekhan 4.2.0

This minor release adds multilingual Whisper controls for dictation and Agent Mode.

## What's Changed

### Multilingual Dictation
- Added Settings → Audio controls for spoken language and transcription mode.
- Sends the selected spoken language to Whisper-compatible endpoints.
- Sends whisper.cpp's explicit `translate=true|false` flag so Transcribe mode is not affected by server-level translation defaults.
- Clarified that Whisper translation mode translates speech to English.

# Shuddhalekhan 4.1.1

This patch release focuses on internal architecture cleanup for the Electron main process, MCP configuration, and Settings UI. User-facing behavior is intended to remain unchanged.

## What's Changed

### Architecture Cleanup

- Added shared window lifecycle, sidecar event routing, sidecar config restart policy, MCP config normalization, and text injection modules.
- Split MCP settings UI and settings IPC access into dedicated renderer modules.
- Expanded regression coverage for the new module seams.

## Update Note

No breaking changes. This release preserves existing configuration and workflows while improving maintainability and test coverage.

# Shuddhalekhan 4.1.0

This release delivers a comprehensive UI/UX polish pass with a new cohesive color theme, cleaner settings window, and native-feeling agent toasts.

## What's Changed

### New Theme: Arctic Steel
- Replaced the jarring slate-grey + yellow + red palette with a cool, cohesive **Arctic Steel** theme.
- New primary color is a soft cyan (`hsl(195 65% 65%)`) — calm and distinctive.
- Destructive/agent states now use muted coral (`hsl(355 55% 60%)`) instead of harsh bright red.
- Success states use soft teal (`hsl(165 45% 55%)`).
- Warning states are warm amber (`hsl(35 70% 60%)`), clearly distinct from primary.
- Background shifted to deep blue-black (`hsl(215 16% 7%)`) for a refined, native dark feel.

### Settings Window Redesign
- Adopted a **floating panel / sheet** style inspired by Apple System Settings and Windows 11.
- Sidebar and content area now share the same background with a single subtle 1px separator.
- Eliminated all hardcoded hex colors (`#101214`, `#181b1e`, etc.) in favor of Tailwind theme tokens.
- Replaced arbitrary Tailwind values with standard tokens for consistency and scalability.
- Navigation simplified to minimal text-only rows with hover/active states.
- Layout standardized: flex rows for toggles, stacked label-above-input for text fields.
- MCP server cards and tool policy editor cleaned up.
- Shortcut display redesigned as **individual keycaps** with 3D gradient styling.
- Windows key now shows the **official Windows logo icon** instead of plain text.

### Agent Toast Redesign
- Removed CSS grid pattern overlays and all gradient backgrounds.
- Adopted a minimal, native-feeling **card aesthetic**: `bg-card`, `border-border`, subtle shadow.
- State communicated via a **small left accent border** color-coded by state:
  - Blue for agent thinking / streaming
  - Amber (thicker border + stronger shadow) for approval
  - Red for failure / cancelled
  - Green for completed
- Typography standardized to theme tokens.

### Architecture Cleanup
- Removed the hidden `MainWindow` that was never shown. The tray menu and settings window are now the only persistent user-facing surfaces.
- Added `@svgl` registry support for high-quality SVG icon components.

## Update Note

No breaking changes. All existing configuration and behavior remain identical — only visual presentation has changed.
